#### provider
In React Native, a provider is a component that allows you to provide data or functionality to your application and make it available to all the components in your application. It works similar to a context provider in React, but with some slight differences.
```
<Provider theme={DefaultTheme}>
   <Text>React native mobile app.</Text>
</Provider>
```
